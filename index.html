  <h4>About Bees</h4>
  <h5>Information from <a href="https://pestworldforkids.org/pest-guide/bees/">pestworldforkids.com</a></h5>
<p>There are about 20,000 different species of bees in the world. Bees live in colonies that contain the queen bee, the worker bee and the drone. The worker bee and the queen bee are both female, but only the queen bee can reproduce. All drones are male. Worker bees clean the hive, collecting pollen and nectar to feed the colony and they take care of the offspring. The drone’s only job is to mate with the queen. The queen’s only job is to lay eggs.
Bees store their venom in a sac attached to their stinger and only female bees sting. That is because the stinger, called an ovipositor, is part of the female bee’s reproductive design. A queen bee uses her ovipositor to lay eggs as well as sting. Sterile females, also called worker bees, don’t lay eggs. They just use their ovipositors to sting.
Bees see all colors except the color red. That and their sense of smell help them find the flowers they need to collect pollen. Not only is pollen a food source for bees, but also some of the pollen is dropped in flight, resulting in cross pollination. The relationship between the plant and the insect is called symbiosis.</p>

  <h4>10 Bee Facts</h4>
  <h5>Information from <a href="https://matteroftrust.org/20-amazing-honey-bee-facts/">matteroftrust.org</a></h5>
  <li>Honey bees must gather nectar from two million flowers to make one pound of honey.</li>
  <li>One bee has to fly about 90,000 miles – three times around the globe – to make one pound of honey.</li>
  <li>A colony of bees consists of 20,000-60,000 honey bees and one queen. Worker honey bees are female, live for about 6 weeks and do all the work.</li>
  <li>Honey bees communicate with one another by dancing.</li>
  <li>Honey has always been highly regarded as a medicine. It is thought to help with everything from sore throats and digestive disorders to skin problems and hay fever.</li>
  <li>Larger than the worker bees, the male honey bees (also called drones), have no stinger and do no work. All they do is mate.</li>
  <li>The bees’ buzz is the sound made by their wings which beat 11,400 times per minute.</li>
  <li>When a bee finds a good source of nectar it flies back to the hive and shows its friends where the nectar source is by doing a dance which positions the flower in relation to the sun and hive. This is known as the ‘waggle dance.’</li>
  <li>Honey’s ability to attract and retain moisture means that it has long been used as a beauty treatment. It was part of Cleopatra’s daily beauty ritual.</li>
  <li>Honey is incredibly healthy and includes enzymes, vitamins, minerals. It’s the only food that contains “pinocembrin”, an antioxidant associated with improved brain functioning.</li>

<h4>Bee Endangerment</h4>
<h5>Information from <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/01/bumblebees-endangered-species-rusty-patched/#close">nationalgeographic.com</a></h5>
<p>For the first time in the United States, a species of bumblebee is endangered.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Tuesday on its website that the rusty patched bumblebee (Bombus affins), once a common sight, is “now balancing precariously on the brink of extinction.” Over the past two decades, the bumblebee’s population has declined 87 percent, according to the announcement.
The news comes just a few months after the first ever bees were declared endangered in the U.S. In September, seven species of Hawaiian bees, including the yellow-faced bee (Hyaleus anthracinus), received protection under the Endangered Species Act. (Read “For the First Time, Bees Declared Endangered in the U.S.”)
The threats facing those seven species are similar to the ones that have depleted rusty patched bumblebee populations: loss of habitat, diseases and parasites, pesticides, and climate change. This is a big deal not only for bees but for humans, too—after all, bees pollinate a lot of our food.
“Bumblebees are among the most important pollinators of crops such as blueberries, cranberries, and clover and almost the only insect pollinators of tomatoes,” according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s rusty patched bumblebee profile. “The economic value of pollination services provided by native insects (mostly bees) is estimated at $3 billion per year in the United States.” (See seven intimate pictures that reveal the beauty of bees.)In its announcement about the rusty patched bumblebees’ endangered status, the department listed ways that individuals can help stop the bees’ decline. These include planting native flowers, limiting or avoiding pesticides, and fostering “natural landscapes and leave grass and garden plants uncut after summer to provide habitat for overwintering bees.”
Unlike Stephen Colbert, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stopped short of telling people to teach the bees about military history and engineering.</p>
