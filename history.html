<p>Html has come a long way with many updates. Before the revised specifications and standards, each version allowed its user to create web pages in the much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.</p>

    <td>Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</td>
    <td>Was widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0.</td>
    <td>Currently released and used worldwide, HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01</td>

    <p>JavaScript is arguably one of the most important languages today. The rise of the web has taken JavaScript places it was never conceived to be.</p>

    <td>Developer Marc Andreessen helped the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois to launch Mosaic: a user-friendly, graphical web browser. The Internet was evolving from being a text-based realm of hobbyists to a multimedia universe for mainstream computer users.</td>
        <td>Andreessen founded the private Mosaic Communications Corporation and published a commercial browser called Mosaic Navigator in 1994 (the name was changed to Netscape after settling a lawsuit.) Netscape Navigator was a hit and Netscape's stellar IPO set new records.</td>
        <td>Netscape made a deal with another Microsoft competitor, which was debuting a major programming language, Java.  It was at this point in early 1995 that Brendan Eich was famously contracted by Netscape to design such a language in 10 days. </td>
        <td>Netscape realized that for an interactive, dynamic web to succeed, JavaScript would have to be consistent across browsers, so they asked the Ecma International standards organization to codify the language. The organization laid out the platform-agnostic specifications for "ECMAScript", the language commonly known as JavaScript.</td>
        <td>ECMAScript went through revisions and spinoffs. ES2 and ES3 brought a number of important features, such as “exceptions,” a standard way of handling errors in code, continuing the JavaScript change from "scripting glue" toward a language for applications.</td>
        <td>Jesse James Garrett popularized AJAX, a set of techniques that enable JavaScript-powered websites to be like fast native apps. The JS scene made new libraries like jQuery and MooTools which made it easier to apply design patterns. JS was now being used to construct desktop-style products like Gmail and Google Maps.</td>
        <td>ES5 was released and the Ecma community once again piled on a wishlist of new JS features for ES6. This resulted in another protracted consensus process, spanning an interminable six years, and practically doubled the size of ECMAScript.</td>
        <td>JS became a fundamental part of the web. Development teams were pushing to fill gaps in JS's capabilities, and the committee in charge of the Ecma standardization process saw that the community was moving faster than a six-year release cycle could satisfy. A new system allows features to be proposed, researched, and ratified in parallel. Every year, Ecma releases whichever features are deemed ready. ES6 was officially published as ES2015, and since then, ES2016 and ES2017 have delivered only incremental changes.</td>

    <p>CSS ensures that your web pages are consistent. Imagine a website with 100s of pages, now imagine having to input the code to define heading sizes, layout and other display data and mix that all in with the content each time you wanted to produce a new page. Also, imagine having a site with 100s of pages and being able to change just one of them while keeping all the rest the same – CSS also makes that a possibility. Using CSS delivers consistency where it is needed but is flexible enough to enable you to make changes to individual pages or sections. Norwegian Håkon Wium Lie created css,  in 1994 he sought to create a universal standardised style sheet for the World Wide Web.</p>

     <td>Allows the user to create presentations from documents and to select from a wider range of fonts. CSS3 allows the user to incorporate rounded borders and use multiple columns. CSS3 is considered to be easier to use (when compared to CSS2) because it has different modules. </td>
